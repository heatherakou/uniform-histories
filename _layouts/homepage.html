				<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

				{{ content }}
				<!-- <p>Like all historians, I’m interested in the stories people tell that help document change and continuity over time. Like most <em>digital</em> historians, I explore these stories using a variety of digital tools and new methods. <strong><em>When digital historians make use of tools and methods developed by other disciplines for our analytical and presentational projects, we inherit the priorities and norms of those disciplines. My goal is to prioritize history’s disciplinary norms as the foundation for the design of digital-history tools and methods.</em></strong> My research trajectory as a digital historian, then, is focused on the concurrent and intertwined development of historical theory, digital-history tools, and historical methods. That research output takes four primary forms, from which I draw to articulate the individual elements of <a href="/research">six major research projects</a>:</p> -->
	
				<!-- <ol>
				<li>digital-tool and historical-method design with a variety of partners</li>
				<li>analytical digital-history projects in collaboration with other historians using digital tools and methods</li>
				<li>digital public engagement projects in collaboration with academic and non-academic communities using digital tools and methods</li>
				<li>digital-humanities capacity-building and scholarly-communications research that explores how to better incorporate digital tools and methods into the academy</li>
				</ol> -->
