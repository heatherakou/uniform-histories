shortdesc: "Postcard from the French Lick Sheraton Hotel in French Lick, Indiana (owned by Sheraton from 1954 to 1979).  Shows a Black waiter balancing a tray of food and beverages on his head.  He is wearing black pants and shoes, a black necktie, and a white button-down shirt and double-breasted jacket with black buttons.  Many of the hotel's Black workers (waiters, bell boys, porters) had moved to French Lick from Kentucky to work at the hotel and other area businesses.  In the early 1900s, they fielded a Negro League baseball team called the French Lick Plutos.  For more, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Lick_Springs_Hotel "
