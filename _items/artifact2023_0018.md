creationdate: "1935 to 1950"
shortdesc: "Cap worn by a doorman at Thornton Place in Atlanta, Georgia, also known as the 'Ten Park Place Building.'  When it was built in the early 1930s, it was considered ultra-modern.  (For more information, see: https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/city-planning/office-of-design/urban-design-commission/the-ten-park-place-building-thornton-building).  The cap has a ventilation system made of bamboo caning and a white inner layer of cotton fabric to protect the (dark green) outer layer from the wearer's sweat.  The name of the building is embroidered in red on the front; the contrasting color scheme (green and red) is very bold, which is not uncommon for doormen.  Manufacturer unknown.  Cotton twill with bamboo caning and a leather visor."
