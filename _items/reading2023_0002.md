shortdesc: "The 'National Defense Act' was debated under the Wilson administration and passed in preparation for likely involvement in WWI.  Although it focuses on the organization of military branches in the United States, this was also the first law making it illegal for civilians to dress like soldiers.  It was widely adopted by other government agencies such as the Postal Service, the National Park Service, and local/state police.  Citation: 'Chapter 134, National Defense Act, June 3, 1916,' The Statutes at Large of the United States of America from December 1915 to March 1917, Volume 39, Part I: Public Acts and Resolutions (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1917)."
