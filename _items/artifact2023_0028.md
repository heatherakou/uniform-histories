shortdesc: "Catalogue for the Degree of Pocahontas, women's auxiliary of the Improved Order of Red Men (IORM), a secret society unique to the United States that was popular in the early 1900s.  Features supplies for rituals and record-keeping, decorations, regalia for private ceremonies and badges for public ceremonies.  The Degree of Pocahontas restricted membership to white women, but all of the imagery was based on white fantasies about indigenous cultures.  Unlike better-known secret societies (like the Freemasons), women did not need a male relative in the IORM to join, although men were welcome to attend rituals and a few were needed to serve in dramatic roles ('Powhatan' and 'John Smith').  The national society allowed members to make their own regalia and decorations, but Ward-Stilson offered standardized equipment and uniforms."
