shortdesc: "Press photo showing a Black meter maid (Parking Control Officer), Andrea Bernard, in New Orleans wearing a short-sleeved button-down uniform shirt with a badge, belt, and sunglasses (no cap).  She is placing a parking ticket on the windshield of a car.  Contributing writer identified as Ron Virgets.  Newsprint taped to the back of the press photo was published in the Times-Picayune, but this particular photograph was an unpublished extra.  Dated July 12, 1985.  Purchased by Heather Akou on eBay.  Article notes, 'Andrea Bernard says her black rubber-soled shoes from the Army surplus store will last her six months, if she sews the soles and caps the heels.  Small wonder.  A day in the life of Andrea Bernard involves 7 1/2 hours of combing a section of the French Quarter between St. Louis Cathedral and St. Jude's Shrine on North Rampart Street. [ ... ]... it's hard to find a job more feared or reviled than the one performed by Bernard and her 100 or so colleagues in the city's Parking Control Division.'
