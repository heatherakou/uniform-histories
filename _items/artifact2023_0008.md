shortdesc: "Promotional postcard mailed in December 1945 ('The Harvey Girls' by MGM was released in January 1946).  Shows one of the main characters, Judy Garland, wearing the uniform of a Harvey House waitress.  The ankle-length black dress with white apron and white cuffs was an accurate depiction of the uniform, designed by Theresa dell Angelica (co-founder of a small manufacturing business that would eventually become Angelica Uniform Co.) for Fred Harvey in the 1880s.  First-known mass-produced work uniform for women in the United States.  Back of the postcard reads, 'The story of the Harvey Girls is being told on the screen in a new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Technicolor musical production, starring Judy Garland.  THE HARVEY GIRLS tells how Fred Harvey waitresses of the 1890s brought romance and civilizing influence to a typical frontier town.'  Sent to a recipient in North Carolina."
