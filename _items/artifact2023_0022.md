shortdesc: "Iron-on patch with the Holiday Inn logo.  Never used (since the adhesive is intact), but could have been applied to a generic piece of clothing to make it a Holiday Inn uniform.  Green with a yellow, embroidered border.  Says 'Holiday Inn' (registered trademark) in script with a yellow and orange pinwheel.  This particular logo was used from 1983 to 2003 (https://1000logos.net/holiday-inn-logo/).  2 by 3 inches.  The fabric is a sturdy twill, probably polyester."
