shortdesc: "Catalogue (24 pages) of paper sewing patterns for home use, produced by 'Pennsylvania Farmer' (a journal for rural households in Pennsylvania).  The pattern department was located on 243 West 17th Street, New York.  Illustrations of finished clothing for women and children, plus a pattern for gloves that could be cut out of the catalogue and immediately used for sewing.  The cover and last five pages feature work uniforms.  First page inside the catalogue notes, 'Let us picture you as you are today in this year of rationing... and heroism, 1943.  You've a slenderer-than-ever waist, you've a smoother-than-ever hips, your skirt is wide enough to leave you action-free, but not too wide!  Fads and furbelows you disdain with upturned nose.  You're a woman of action now... full of pep and patriotism, throwing all of your energy into the service of your country.  Saving!  Conserving!  Salvaging!  Working!  That's you in 1943.'  8.5 by 11 inches with two-color illustrations throughout.  Fragile, magazine-style paper."
