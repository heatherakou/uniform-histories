shortdesc: "Two-piece uniform for a casino worker (cocktail waitress?) at Players Island casino in Metropolis, Illinois (1993-2000), one of the first casinos in Illinois.  Now known as Harrah's Metropolis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrah%27s_Metropolis.  Manufactured by Aaron Davis Associates, size 10L.  The top is close-fitting like a corset or 19th-century bodice and has tiered cap sleeves.  It closes in the back with a zipper hidden by a placket.  The skirt is also tiered and wraps around the hips, closing with just two buttons at the waistline.  The hemline is asymetric (12in at the short, 18in at the longest).  The tiers are gem colors (purple, dark pink, and emerald green).  The body of the top is a very colorful, batik-like 'tropical' print.  Sold on eBay as a 'Carmen Miranda' costume.  The rental fee was $25 with a $50 deposit.  Fully lined, made of polyester satin."
